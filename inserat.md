Necessities like toilet paper and cleaning utensils we also buy with a shared budget, but the rest (food and such) is organized individually.

## Who we're looking for

You are loosely approximating our age span.

Your gender, origin, and general life choices are not relevant to us, as long as you're not some sort of extremist.

A requirement is, that you can converse all right with everyone – speak some English.
